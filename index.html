  <h1>The Wonderful Universe of Reeti</h1>
  <h2>Everything the average person must know about me!</h2>
  <h4>Hi! I'm Reeti. I am a nice, rather strange middle-school child who loves reading, learning new things, and hanging out with my friends!</h2>
  <h3>Some things about me!</h3>
  <p>-The most likely thing I am doing at any time is reading :) <br> -I enjoy science and learning new things about it <br> -I also LOVE creative writing! I enjoy writing fictional stories, including fantasy and realistic and historical fiction. <br> -My favorite thing to be doing in the entire world is sitting in a secret hideout in my backyard, reading <br> -I like talking with my friends and family, although I am often caught reading in the corner of larger social events! <br> </p>
  <h3>Some of my hobbies</h3>
  <p> Obviously, I LOVE reading and writing</p>
